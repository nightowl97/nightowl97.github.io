  <div>
    <p>Something I didn't know existed until recently is <em>Dynamic Programming</em>. If, like me,
you knew computer scientists use a lot of different techniques to optimize their algorithms,
but were intimidated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization#Major_subfields">Wikipedia article</a>, then this article is for you.
Dynamic Programming is pretty straightforward, even if it sounds imposing and scary. I've looked around trying to find why it's called what it is, and the reasons are mostly because it sounds impressive.
We'll only talk about one of its simplest applications for now, just to dip our toes in the water.</p>
<h3>A simple recursive algorithm:</h3>
<p>If you ever took a programming/CS course, then at some point you must have learned about recursion. One of the common first examples you learn about is this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This function clearly gives you the <code>n</code>-th number in the famous Fibonacci sequence. The first time
you see and understand this, it seems brilliant, elegant and pretty much perfect. But with a deeper look, this algorithm is actually going to turn out to be pretty bad.
I'm not going to talk about whether Recursion is <em>inherently</em> good or bad. If that's what you're interested in, I'll just refer you to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3093/4203245">Stack Overflow answer.</a>
First, try and run this function for a big enough n, say 100 for example. It's going to take a
<em>very long</em> time. This is the timing <code>fib(40)</code> and <code>fib(100)</code> in a python 2 interpreter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="mi">102334155</span>
<span class="o">---</span> <span class="mf">80.5310001373</span> <span class="n">seconds</span> <span class="o">---</span>
<span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="o">---</span>  <span class="n">seconds</span> <span class="o">---</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The time it takes doesn't increase linearly with <code>n</code>, this algorithm takes exponential time. I'm sure you can understand if I don't have the patience to wait for it to calculate a higher number.</p>
<h3>Here's why it's slow:</h3>
<p>As an example, let's take a look at the recursion tree when we compute <code>fib(6)</code>:
<img alt="Recursion Tree" src="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~janst/311/Notes/Topic-22/Fig-27-1-Fib-Recursion-Tree-Small.jpg"></p>
<p>Each node represents a function call, and as you can see, we call:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fib(4)</code> Twice</li>
<li><code>fib(3)</code> 3 times</li>
<li><code>fib(2)</code> 5 times</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact every call on the right side of the tree has already been computed in the left side, and yet our function will recompute each call as if it's never seen it before. Imagine if we had a big number, we'd have to call the function on the same big numbers multiple times, calls on small <code>n</code>s will happen at least a few hundred thousand times.
That means a lot of clock cycles wasted on redundant and completely unnecessary calculations.
If <code>T(n)</code> is the time it takes to calculate the <code>fib(n)</code> then:</p>
<p><code>T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) = T(n - 2) + T(n - 3) + T(n - 3) + T(n - 4) etc</code></p>
<p>And so forth, each step calling T twice, which means: <code>T(n) = 2 * 2 * 2 *...* 2 = 2ⁿ</code></p>
<p>This is a time complexity <code>O(2ⁿ)</code> hence an exponential time algorithm. If you can help it, you should always try to avoid exponential time, because it is very costly as you can see from the diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="Time complexity" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Comparison_computational_complexity.svg/512px-Comparison_computational_complexity.svg.png"></p>
<p>One last thing. Every time a recursive call happens, it takes a bit of memory from the call stack. The amount that is taken is called the stackframe, and is only freed when the function returns. In a low level language, deep recursion will eat up all the memory and cause a stack overflow. High level languages usually have some sort of guards against this. In python for example, you'll cause a maximum recursion depth error. Sure you can get around these guards, but they are there for a reason, and you'll rarely be justified in circumventing them.</p>
<h3>The Dynamic Programming approach:</h3>
<p>The second to last 'subfield' in the previously mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization#Major_subfields">article</a> is Dynamic Programming. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic programming studies the case in which the optimization strategy is based on splitting the problem into smaller subproblems. The equation that describes the relationship between these subproblems is called the Bellman equation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The splitting-a-problem-into-subproblems part seems simple enough in principle, but how is that actually done?
The problem with the first algorithm is the repetition. Each recursive call is costly, so we should only have to calculate each <code>n</code>-th number once. First thing that comes to mind is to just save each <code>fib(n)</code> we compute, and cut off the recursion if we ever call the function on that same <code>n</code> later. Seems simple right? That's exactly the way we're going to do it.
Whenever the <code>fib</code> function is called, we will store its result in memory. Later when it's called with the same argument again, instead of recursing for a second time (again and again down to the base case), we just need to pull the result that we already stored in memory. This is going to make for a much better algorithm, and that's because reading from memory takes constant time, not exponential time (essentially free). Here's a possible implementation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">mem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">:</span>        <span class="c1"># If we&#39;ve already computed it</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">]</span>   <span class="c1"># then just return that</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>                          <span class="c1"># These lines</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span>                        <span class="c1"># are still</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>                               <span class="c1"># pretty much</span>
        <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c1"># the same</span>
        <span class="n">mem</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">res</span>            <span class="c1"># Store this result for eventual reuse</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">res</span>              <span class="c1"># And now you can return the result.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In dynamic programming, we solve all the subproblems and use their results to solve our main problem.
The "subproblems" in our case are the all the  <code>fib(k)</code>s where <code>k &lt; n</code> and we stored the result of each subproblem in memory for eventual reuse. It's also pretty clear that <code>T(n) = Time for each subproblem * Number of subproblems</code>
If you try and run this, you're going to notice a gigantic jump in performance because this is now a linear time algorithm O(n).
So much so that even I had the patience to wait for it to calculate the 500-th number:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">answer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="mi">139423224561697880139724382870407283950070256587697307264108962948325571622863290691557658876222521294125</span>
<span class="o">---</span> <span class="mf">0.00100016593933</span> <span class="n">seconds</span> <span class="o">---</span>
</pre></div>

<p>That was a pretty big number and it did it in roughly 1 millisecond? Hey, that's pretty good!</p>
<p>That's pretty much the idea of dynamic programming: Recursion + Memory.
Our algorithm worked its way down the tree starting from the top, but there's also <em>Bottom-up Dynamic Programming</em> which, as you might expect, works its way from the bottom. It's also pretty simple to implement, especially for something as easy as fibonacci, but that's something I'll let you do yourself.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That was a pretty good improvement, but it's possible to do even better. Our algorithm might still cause maximum recursion depth errors, and it's possible to make a logarithmic time O(log n) algorithm using the closed form for fibonacci numbers, also known as Binet's formula:</p>
<p><code>fib(n) = Floor([Phiⁿ / sqrt(5)] + 1/2)</code>  where Phi is the gloden ratio</p>
<p>You might think this is constant time but due to the powers in the formula, we need to use the <code>math.pow()</code> function, which is not O(1) like the usual addition and multiplication operations.
It's also worth noting that this method is subject to floating point errors during computations with big numbers, so your results might be slightly off if you decide to try it for yourself.</p>
<p>That's about it for now, I hope you learned something with me today.</p>
